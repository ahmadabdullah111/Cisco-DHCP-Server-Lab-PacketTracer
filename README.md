# DHCP Server Lab - Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer lab simulation focused on configuring and understanding DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) in a networked environment. 

## Lab Overview
- **Tool Used:** Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Lab Title:** DHCP Server LAB v1.0
- **Objective:** To demonstrate the working of a DHCP server assigning IP addresses dynamically to client devices.
- **Target Audience:** Networking students and beginners seeking hands-on experience with DHCP.

## Topology Includes:
- DHCP Server
- Switch(es)
- Multiple Client PCs
- Basic IP addressing and subnetting
- DHCP pool configuration
- Static IP reservation (if applicable)

## How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file using Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.2.1 or later recommended).
2. Review the configuration.
3. Observe how the client devices receive IPs dynamically from the DHCP server.
4. Modify or extend the topology as needed for deeper learning.
